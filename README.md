# i-saw-that

> when you `npm install` in a clean branch and some dependency break

```sh
$ i-saw-that <broken-dependency>
```

## use with npx

```sh
$ npx i-saw-that @some/npm-package
```

and you see all publishes sorted by time

and if there is recent one

maybe they broke it and its their fault just saying
